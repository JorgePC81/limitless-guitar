Full Stack Software Development. Project One.  
In this website, the aim is to give an opportunity to the viewers, to learn to play guitar or if they already play a bit of guitar, then to become expert at it. It is formed by different sections and by different techniques. These techniques courses have the role of making good instrumentalists who can manage the most important aspects of the guitar routine.

In the first part, a schedule and a philosophy are given to the viewer to start thinking about what they really want to achieve with this guitar method. In the section exercises, they will find an introduction for every pillar technique. Finally, the learners will find in the last page, a subscription page to go further in their learning and enjoy private lessons and other services. This website is a guitar method targeted for any person who is interested in learning an instrument at any level. They will have the most important steps described in the section exercises and they can after join a more personalized tuition provided by the teacher. The customer can attend and learn from all over the world.

Is my website responsive on different devices?


Features
Title and navigation section





This section gives the user the opportunity to see the name of the website and navigate across the three sections of the site: home, exercises and signup.

Code design: in this section, I have used the zoom as a special tool with the use of @keyframes. The menu on the top-right has been placed using navigation <nav> and anchor <a>, in order to load every single part of the site.
The informative square has been added with a relative position in order to move according to its parent.
Everytime the logo is clicked, the website loads the home page; as it is common to see in the typical website.


HOME SECTION


Logo and home photo

In this section we introduce one type of guitar for more accompanying role or more acoustic styles. The logo speaks about what the tasks will be in this website. It says: LIMITLESS GUITAR:  ALL STYLES, ALL LEVELS, ALL TECHNIQUES.

Home center: why playing guitar? and guitar philosophy







In part, there is a description of why playing guitar is good for any person and a photo of a guitar learner immersed in the guitar learning journey.

The design for this section consists of an image styling, making it rounded with the tool radius. The texts about guitar philosophy use the website font and are justified to the edges of the page.


The secret to success






This part shows the viewer what is the secret for success in music playing. It divides the whole guitar learning in 5 sections and creates a schedule for the viewer.

The design of this “secret to success” section consists of a photo in the background and 5 different sections separated by white borders. 

Footer with exterior links



Here the viewer can choose between four different websites linked to Limitless Guitar in terms of authorship and content. These links are shared on the three footers of the website.


The social media is formed by four websites. The code is a group of anchors <a> with the respective icons.



EXERCISES SECTION


Guitar Photo








The Guitar Photo shows an electric guitar of a high standard, in order to show some variety of guitars to the viewer and for the aesthetics of the web.


In the design of this image above, the process is very similar to the one in the home page. The only two changes are the photo and the radius applied in height and width.
As you may see, the menu underlines the section we are on at the top right of the page.








Title








The title has been prepared on purpose to give the viewer an inspiring welcome to the exercises videos.
The code design in the exercises needed different aspects about borders, margin and padding. In addition paragraphs <p> and images <img> needed to be similar in length. Furthermore, I have allowed fullscreen mode to enjoy the whole screen of the device. Columns vary from 4 to 1 depending on the used device.


Exercises videos

The eight videos are there to guide the student in the first moments of their learning, for beginners, and to guide the learner in a more serious manner when they are more expert, showing different levels of guitar playing in the videos.



SIGNUP SECTION






This section is composed of a picture and a filling out form to sign up if the viewer is interested in further learning with the guitar.
The code design of the SignUp section consists of a photo in cover option to enjoy the full size, and a form with an action button. After completing it, the viewer will be guided to a section where this person can see the info completed and the sign up result.


Features to add in the near future:

The idea left to implement in the website is elaborating a payment method with a database for the viewers who want to pay and enjoy a more specialist and personalized tuition for a specific period of time.
Applied Technologies 

I have used some relevant tools in this project:
Languages: HTML, CSS, 
Coding software: Visual Studio Code 3


Libraries

I have used Pexels for free, relevant photos used on the web. I have used fontawesome for the use of icons in the site. Google Fonts is another site used in this website to have a consistent text format. Facebook and YouTube have also been used to acquire the video-lessons from me, as lecturer. Finally, I have used W3Schools website to have some examples for guidance on Hovering, Zooming and other relevant effects.

Testing
This website has been used in different browsers, such as Google Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox. All of them worked without problems and showed accurately all the features. There was sometimes a change of size, for some reason, which did not have a negative repercussion on the web.
All the features of the website have been tested. For instance, every different part of the site has been checked with phone, tablet, small computer and big computer sizes. The results have been satisfactory. All the links direct to the right place and in different tab; be it from the footer icons, the YouTube videos or with the Facebook ones.
The video-exercises worked successfully and show the content in different sizes and options for the viewer; be it in different devices, full-screen or minimasied. 
The signup section is working perfectly, except that there is not yet a database and a paying method for the customers to join in.


Validator Testing
The four checkable parts of the website, namely Home, Exercises, SignUp, and Css have come out from the Code Institute troubleshooting check for CSS and HTML with zero mistakes. I changed a few parts of the code at the end of the project and I always checked with the HTML, CSS test, so that the code is updated and clean of bugs/mistakes.

Unfixed Bugs
There is only one problem/bug that has bothered me at the end of the project. It is that in the SignUp section, there is a photo of a guitar in the background that shows in the Visual Studio Code 3, but it does not show in the actual deployed website.

Deployment

The deployment took place on the 27th of June. The code has been modified a few times and updated again through GitHub.
My site has been deployed using Visual Studio Code 3; transferring updates to GitHub, by using the terminal. 
In GitHub, I have used the project repository and I have gone to settings, then pages on the left side; now I chose the main option, saved it and after 1 minute the website was ready to open.

Content


The content of my website is original. I have used much help from the Love Running project realized before starting with this one. I have used all videos of me playing guitar so nobody else is included on the course material. The idea of the project comes after considering my expertise on the guitar and how much I can help my students. 
Media


The photos used in this web are from Pexels.
The videos used for the exercises page were taken from this other open source site: YouTube and Facebook and I am the owner of all videos.
Inspiration/Motivation

I have been inspired by several websites which distribute their product in similar way. They are:
1- https://pauldavidsguitar.com/guitarcourses/. This website and this guitarist have given me ideas to complete my site, in terms of content. He uses several pages to progressively show his skills and offer tuition.


2- https://www.musicstore.com/nl_NL/EUR. It is a very good commercial website. Although I have not applied product selling yet in this website, this option is a must in the near future, where customers will be able to buy tuition from my site.
